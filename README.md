## Description

This Home Weather Clock project is my first real STM32 project. An STM32 F767 board is used as the heart of the system.

I intend to build a system to collect temperature, humidity pressure sensor using a BME280 sensor, and store it in a database or logging system on a MicroSD card. I will later add additional sensors to store even more weather data. I will also connect a RTC sensor to store timestamps for the weather data.

Once I have the basics down, I will implement TinyML to try to predict the weather around my house using machine learning trained on the data I collect.
